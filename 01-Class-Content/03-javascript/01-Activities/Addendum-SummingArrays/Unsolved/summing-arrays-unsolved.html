      // Creating two arrays with number values
      var firstArray = [5, 4, 5, 7, 9];

      var secondArray = [-1, 4, 3, 12, 7, -4, 2, 2, 0];

      //Write two for-loops, one for each array, and sum the elements of each array
      //Then, add the two results together and console log that result.
      //HINT: you'll need to create a variable (or more) to store the sums.




      //Now, let's turn the above repetition into a function
      //Wite a function that takes in an array as argument, loops through it, and returns the sum
      //Use that function to sum the two above arrays and console log the result.




      //BONUS: if you're finished early, write a function that takes a number as the argument (n) and returns an array with length n, and is filled with random values
      //HINT: you'll need to use Math.floor and Math.random to generate your random numbers, similar to the RPS game
